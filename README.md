Real-estate Management System 

This system was developed using JEE at the backed and AngularJS i.e. Angular V 1.0 at front end. 

It was a brilliant idea to dynamically generate all the forms and girds of the project through JSON. 
But after over 6 months of effort, a new version of Angular was introduced discarding all of our effort.
So the AngularJS GUI needed to be either converted to latest version or to another technology. 
This make us lose our interest in Angular and we paused this project while started exploring other technologies like React and Vue JS. 

Backed is Java Servlet "DomainObjectsManager" that takes JSON request for domain objects and rturns JSON response.

The upcoming efforts might include, switching the front end from AngularJS to Vue.
